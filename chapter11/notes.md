# Abstract DataTypes

* Types are static and are resolved at compile time, they have no significance at runtime.
* Data constructor matters at runtime.

## What makes these datatypes algebraic ?
* All these datatypes can be classified into Sum or Product types.
* Sum and Products can be explained in the terms of cardinality.
